# Node.js Challenge

## Description
Creating a command-line application to generate a README is a critical step in streamlining the process of project documentation. The Node.js Challenge is designed to address this need by offering developers a user-friendly and efficient tool. With just a few prompts, users can input essential information about their projects, and the application dynamically generates a high-quality README file. This ensures that every project follows a standardized structure, including crucial sections like Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

## User Story
As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

### Acceptance Criteria
Given a command-line application that accepts user input:
- When I am prompted for information about my application repository, then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
- When I enter my project title, then this is displayed as the title of the README.
- When I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
- When I choose a license for my application from a list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README, and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
- When I enter my GitHub username, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.
- When I enter my email address, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.
- When I click on the links in the Table of Contents, then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README.
